# US Energy

### Introduction
The increasing demand for energy in our modern world and how to satisfy it is a question that concerns the population and our leaders from a political, engineering and sustainability perspective. The scope of this project is aimed at understanding the production and consumption of energy in the US, based on data for 2018. Where is it being produced? Where is it being consumed? What are the sources of the energy that we are consuming? And how is the role of renewables changing over the years?

### Objective and Techniques
1. Tell a data-driven story with interactive visualizations. 
2. We gathered data from the [U.S. Energy Information Administration](https://www.eia.gov) to create a website with charts of U.S. energy production, consumption and emissions. Specifically, our visualizations compared energy between States as well as compared national renewables production year by year. 
3. We utilized the following tools to create our visualizations: Python Flaskâ€“powered API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript (including D3.js, Charts.js and Leaflet), GeoJSON, and MongoDB.
4. We then deployed our site to [GitHub Pages](https://kphad20.github.io/US-Energy/index.html). To properly run the site, please run "python app.py" in your terminal or command prompt, then go to localhost:5000/renewables in your browser. Additionally, run "python -m http.server" in your terminal or command prompt and go to localhost:8000 in your browser.
