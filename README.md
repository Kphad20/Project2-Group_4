### Objective and Techniques
1. Tell a data-driven story with interactive visualizations. 
2. We gathered data from the [U.S. Energy Information Administration](https://www.eia.gov) to create a website with graphs of U.S. energy production, consumption and emissions. Specifically, our visualizations compared energy between States as well as compared national renewables production year by year. 
3. We utilized the following tools to create our visualizations: Python Flaskâ€“powered API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript (including D3.js, Charts.js and Leaflet), GeoJSON, and MongoDB.
4. We deployed our site to [GitHub Pages](https://kphad20.github.io/US-Energy/index.html). To properly run the site, please run "python app.py" in your terminal or command prompt, then go to localhost:5000/renewables in your browser. Additionally, run "python -m http.server" in your terminal or command prompt and go to localhost:8000 in your browser.
